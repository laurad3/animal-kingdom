# animal-kingdom
During my exchange in Stuttgart I worked in a team of 3 on this project for our User Interface Design course. It is a prototype for an interactive ebook to teach children (mainly in primary school) about animals. We came up with the concept and design for the application. Art was made with Photoshop and the application in Construct 2.
